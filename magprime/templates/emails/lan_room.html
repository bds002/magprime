You are receiving this email because you ticked an interest in <i>PC Gaming</i> (LAN) while pre-registering for MAGFest. For those who are not aware, this is a <i>BYOC</i> or Bring Your Own Computer LAN room. That means we highly recommend bringing your own computer to fully enjoy the MAGFest LAN experience. There may be a few public play PCs this year - but availability is extremely limited. More information on this below.


<br/><br/>
<b><u>NERD NEWS</u></b>
  We have an entirely new GIGABIT network setup this year. Not only are we running gigabit on the client side, the backbone is 10Gigabit Ethernet! You’ll be able to share files with friends and download content from our cache servers faster than you’ve ever downloaded before at MAG! Keep in mind you do need to bring your own ethernet cable - you should be within 20 feet from the nearest switch. We have fewer switches than previous years. <br/><br/>
In addition to our new network we also have a comprehensive network monitoring suite and associated visual effects (lights, etc) which will change with network utilization. If there is a problem we will find out promptly and be able to resolve the issue immediately. <br/><br/>
On the tournament and Theater side of things we have a lot of new and exciting events for you to follow and watch. Definitely check out our new case mod contest this year! See below for more information on all of this and more.

<br/> <br/>
<b><u>LOCATION</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
This year we are back in the Maryland Ballroom, but this time with much more space. There is one entrance and exit which optimizes our ability to make sure your equipment stays put. We are continuing use of the <i>BarcodeSystem</i> for your items' security. However, <i><u>MAGFest is NOT RESPONSIBLE and accepts NO LIABILITY for ANY attendee equipment</u> including but not limited to computers, monitors, and mice. Please keep this in mind while attending MAGFest LAN and secure your personal belongings appropriately!</i>
<br/> <br/>
To better accommodate everyone we are increasing our capacity by almost 150 seats to over 400 total seats. You should still try to arrive by mid-day on Friday to secure yourself a spot.
<br/> <br/>
<b>
    <u>GENERAL RULES OF THE LAN ROOM</u>
</b>
<ul>
    <li> <b>You must follow all LAN staff instructions</b>. Because we said so.</li>
    <li> <b>Your monitor cannot be larger than 36 inches</b> because of limited space. Please limit yourself to using only one monitor. </li>
    <li> <b>No sleeping in the LAN room.</b> Some napping on your keyboard is tolerable, but please leave your sleeping bag in your hotel room.</li>
    <li> <b>Headphones required</b>, no speakers allowed. </li>
    <li> <b>No e-cig/vaping allowed.</b></li>
  <li> <b>Please bring an CAT5e/CAT6 Ethernet cable that is at least 20 feet in length.</b> You will be responsible for hooking up to our network, NOT US.  We will have LIMITED STOCK of pre-packaged ethernet cables for sale for a non-ridiculous price in case you forget to bring one. Because we don’t have enough to go around we will no longer be providing free loaner cables. </li>
    <li> <b>Please bring a power strip for YOUR EQUIPMENT.</b> MAGFest provides one strip for each group of four seats. You plug your power strip into this strip and only this strip. DO NOT DAISY-CHAIN MULTIPLE POWERSTRIPS.</li>
    <li> <b>Please do NOT plug in your own networking equipment</b> such as switches and routers. It can cause problems. <i>Trust us.</i> </li>
    <li> <b>Please adhere to the guidelines that are in the program guide</b> as well as the posted notices in the LAN room as far as conduct and network connections go. </li>

</ul>
<br/> <br/>
<b><u>BADGE FOR PC PROGRAM</u></b>
<br/> <br/>

<br/> <br/>
<b><u>TOURNAMENTS AND CONTESTS</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
There are 21 tournaments and contests planned for this year, with lots of old and new games. We’re including more non-BYOC tournaments (including one using an Oculus Rift Dev Kit) and we’re holding a PC Case Mod Contest. You can find all of the info on all of our tournaments on <a href=”https://www.reddit.com/r/magfestlan/comments/40c5zf/magfest_2016_tournament_schedule_info_and_rules/”>Reddit</a>.
<br/> <br/>
<b><u>LAN THEATER</u></b>
<br/> <br/>
The LAN Theater is back and it’s bigger and better than last year. The Theater is right next to the main LAN room, and is the perfect place to watch many of our premier tournaments. We plan to be livestreaming from the Theater with color commentary, so you can come see the best MAGFest has to offer competing to be #1! We increased the size of the room, so be sure to come by and support competitive PC gaming. Don’t forget to tell your friends to come as well, they might get to the chance to cheer you on!
<br/><br/>
We also plan to include some late night panel-type content in the LAN Theater, so keep an eye out for that. Stop by and check out what we have planned!
